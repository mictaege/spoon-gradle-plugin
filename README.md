# spoon-gradle-plugin

This repository contains a gradle plugin for the Java analysis and transformation framework [Spoon](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/index.html).

> **Note** that there is also an official gradle plugin provided by [SpoonLabs](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/spoon-gradle-plugin).
> The difference between the two plugins is that _SpoonLabs_ plugin focuses on analysis and transformation of Java production files,
> while this plugin focuses on analysis and transformation of Java production _and_ test files. Another difference is that _SpoonLabs_ plugin
> supports Android development, which is not supported by this plugin.

**Work-In-Progress!**
